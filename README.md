Welcome to the OpenCV & MediaPipe Projects repository! This project showcases computer vision applications using OpenCV and MediaPipe, including hand and finger recognition and gesture-based volume control. These implementations utilize real-time hand tracking to detect gestures and perform interactive actions.
Features:
ðŸŽ¯ Hand & Finger Recognition â€“ Detect and track hands, identify fingers, and recognize gestures using MediaPipe Hands.

ðŸ”Š Gesture-Based Volume Control â€“ Adjust system volume using hand gestures detected in real-time.

ðŸ“· Real-Time Processing â€“ Efficient and fast hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.

ðŸ›  Customizable & Scalable â€“ Easily modify the code for additional gesture-based interactions.
